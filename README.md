## 🌸 What is Container Diffoscope?

**Container Diffoscope** is a powerful tool that compares the filesystems of two Docker images at the file level. It helps you understand exactly what changed between image versions by:

- 🔍 **Detecting** identical, modified, and unique files
- 🔐 **Using** SHA256 hashes for accurate comparison
- 📝 **Generating** beautiful markdown diff reports

Perfect for auditing image changes, debugging build differences, or understanding what an update actually modifies.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Compare two Docker images
python -m container_diffoscope ubuntu:20.04 ubuntu:22.04

# With custom output directory
python -m container_diffoscope image1:tag image2:tag --output-dir results
```
